# surface_analysis
Postprocessing scripts for surface dumps in GRAthena++

Clone and install with `cd surface_analysis; pip install .`
The code requires the [tabulatedEOS](https://github.com/max-jacobi/tabulatedEOS) library which pip will install from github.
If this is not possible (i.e. on clusters), you can clone it and install it by hand (`cd tabulatedEOS; pip install .`).

Example usage script in [examples](examples/postprocess_surface.py).
